# Start Over Attempt

This is my attempt to develop the control system from scratch, hoping to gain some knowledge about the details.

## Generate Code

Use STM32CubeMX 6.12.0 to generate code. Note that STM32CubeMX 6.12.1 seems to have bugs that generates code causing an error when running '''make'''.

## Build

Use '''make''' in the project directory.
