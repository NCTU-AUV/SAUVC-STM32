# Start Over Attempt

This is my attempt to develop the control system from scratch, hoping to gain some knowledge about the details.
This branch is intended to develop alongsied [SAUVC2024-RPI/use-ros2](https://github.com/NCTU-AUV/SAUVC2024-RPI/tree/use-ros2).

## Generate Code

Use STM32CubeMX 6.12.0 to generate code. Note that STM32CubeMX 6.12.1 seems to have bugs that generates code causing an error when running `make`.

## Build

Use `make` in the project directory.
